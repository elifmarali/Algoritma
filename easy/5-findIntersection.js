Have the function FindIntersection(strArr) read the array of strings
stored in strArr which will contain 2 elements: the first element will
represent a list of comma-separated numbers sorted in ascending order,
the second element will represent a second list of comma-separated
numbers (also sorted). Your goal is to return a conna-separated string
containing the numbers that occur in elements of strarr in sorted
order. If there is no intersection, return the string false.
